# Goal-app

## Description
This is a MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) application that allows users to register an account, log in, and create time-stamped goals. 

## Usage
- **Account Registration and Login**: Users are first prompted to log in. If they do not have an account, they can register as a new user.
- **Dashboard and Goal Creation**: After logging in, users are directed to the dashboard where they can create new goals.
- **Goal Management**: Created goals are displayed under the goal input section. Users can delete a goal by clicking the trash can icon on the top right of their goal, indicating the completion of the goal.

## Technology Used
- MongoDB/Express/React/Node (MERN Stack)
- Redux for state management.
- Dotenv for environment variable management.
- Mongoose for data modeling.
- Colors for styling enhancements.
